First, install Python from python.org. Open the IDLE program that comes with it. See that blinking cursor? That\u2019s where the magic happens. Type print followed by quotes and your message inside, like print Hello World. Hit enter and boom, your first Python program just ran. Python reads code line by line, like following a recipe. Want to do math? Just type the numbers and symbols directly, like 5 + 3, and Python solves it instantly. Now try a variable, which is like a labeled box for storing data. Type x = 10 then print x. See how it remembers? That\u2019s the power of variables. You just learned the basics of Python in under a minute. Imagine what you could build with a little more practice. Keep coding.",
