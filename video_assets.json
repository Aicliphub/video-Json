First, install Python from the official website. Then open your code editor. Now type print followed by parentheses and quotes. Inside the quotes, write Hello World. Run the code. Boom. You just wrote your first Python program. Python reads like plain English, making it perfect for beginners. Next, try variables. Type x equals 5. Then print x. Run it. The number 5 appears. Variables store data you can reuse. That is the power of Python. Simple, clean, and incredibly powerful. Now go practice these basics. You are officially a Python programmer. Keep coding.",
