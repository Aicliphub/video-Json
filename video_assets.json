Python is one of the easiest programming languages to start with, and today you will write your first line of code. Open any text editor or Python IDE to follow along. First, type print followed by parentheses and quotes. Inside the quotes, write Hello World. Run this code, and congratulations, you just made Python display text. Now lets do math. Type print again, but this time put 5 plus 5 inside the parentheses without quotes. Run it, and you get 10. Python can do calculations instantly. One more thing. Variables store data. Type name equals John inside quotes, then print name. Run it, and Python remembers the name. Thats it. You just learned printing, math, and variables in Python. Keep practicing these basics, and soon you will build amazing projects. Happy coding.",
